# Experience
------------
###Senior Software Engineer - OpinionLab
_July 2013-Present_

- Created a single page application in ClojureScript. Created a dashboarding application that synchronized multiple search and data visualization widgets using core.async. Enabled business analysts to own page customization by composing dashboard pages from available widgets with drag and drop type functionality. Allowed for trivial extension of the product.

- Leveraged Storm as a distributed real-time data processing system for our customer data. Wrote storm bolts and topologies in Clojure.

###Senior Developer - Morningstar Inc.
_May 2012-July 2013_

- Designed and implemented a framework for data distribution to our clients. Our system was rapidly expanding to cover more data and the level of developer effort to meet the growth was higher than we could support. The new system allowed for new data to be added via a few changes in configuration, and has been maintained with trivial effort by multiple team members going forward. 

- Rearchitected data systems to meet business needs. Our data systems could no longer meet our new business needs. I gathered requirements from our business team, created a new architecture for portions of our system, created roadmaps, timelines, estimates, and am currently delivering on these system changes. New system has improved delivery customization, improved monitoring, geographic redundancy, fault tolerance, improved performance, and more.

- Owner of Python based data index system. Inherited a system spanning 5 teams that was regularly failing a very important client. Reworked system wide interactions to produce on time expected deliverables. Created process monitoring and SOP for support. Refactored existing project to allow easy maintainability. Shared coding practices across teams.

- Established VCS/deployment best practices. I researched, proposed, and implemented a version control strategy, build automation with automated testing & traceable artifacts, and fully automated deployment procedures.

- Shared knowledge with other teams. Having identified areas where common knowledge was lacking, I have given presentations and demonstrations on TDD, LINQ, BDD, data structure performance, messaging systems. Also participated in numerous code reviews to help share project level knowledge and specific coding practices.

###Engineer - nPhase (acquired by Verizon in Jan 2012)
_July 2010 – May 2012_

- Designed and implemented internal notification service. Web service can send single or bulk messages to users via a variety of formats, with retries on a configurable interval or until acknowledged. Logged messages and exposed logs via web services. Designed to be high performance and highly available, running on 8 servers. Utilizing Entity Framework 4.1 I optimized all queries for speed. WCF service hosted in IIS utilizing Tibco queues.

- Designed and implemented Group and Bulk action internal service. Exposed web service interface allowing services to request actions are repeated for all devices within a group or a bulk list (example: device activation, wakeup, etc). Service consumed multiple internal services to validate complex device/carrier settings.

- Created reusable customer facing web service APIs to help platformize our product as part of a team. Exposed web services currently enable customers to write their own applications to manage hundreds of thousands of devices through our APIs. APIs are high performance, highly available (99.999%) methods that range from device diagnostic and information to device commissioning. Designed APIs, implemented business logic, validation, calls to internal services, automated unit & integration testing and builds.

- Created SQL Replication Tool. Provided a one click build-up and tear-down for MS SQL Server peer-to-
peer replication. Designed to speed up nPhase production deployments and configurable for use in multiple environments. Utilized SMO & RMO.

- Contributed to Portal website. This ASP.NET website allowed for device maintenance and monitoring. Created pages with extensive server side validation such as customer IP pool setup. Help globalize the site by adding resource pages for multiple language translations. Created pages with ASP controls, javascript, c# server code, MS SQL Server stored procedures.

- Interact directly with new customers, teaching them about our systems, troubleshooting their problems, and creating documentation and guides for the new customers’ development team.

- Presented process improvements and new technologies to nPhase engineering group. Presentations included Entity Framework 4.1, Dependency Injection in Spring.NET, UWS automated functional testing framework.

- Supported legacy ASP.NET web sites. Responded to customer bugs for projects where development had ceased prior to my arrival. Understood systems, diagnosed problems, created QA environments for these solutions, and created automated builds and deployment strategies.

- Created technical documentation for new products, contributed to the functional specification for each product release.

- Participated in code reviews and design reviews (both as reviewer and the person reviewed).

###First Employee - W6
_April 2012 – June 2012_

- Created an e-commerce single page application in MSFT MVC4, jquery, and entity framework. Website allowed for credit card transactions and purchases.

###Senior Associate Economist Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
_May 2004 – July 2010_

- Developed custom software for over 15 research projects. Projects ranged from full sample restricted census data to county specific employment micro data. Programs focused on data acquisition/parsing, cleaning, formatting, running extensive economic models, presenting regressions and graphs. As the programmer, I was responsible for understanding the economics and math in order to implement the model in my code. My programs were loosely coupled so that economic model code could be applied to other data sets. Speed was a premium due to the size of the datasets; I was often able to optimize existing models to reduce runtimes from weeks to hours. 

- Devised and implemented dynamic programming methods to solve economic problems. 

- Learned new languages for specific projects including learning Fortran to parallelize a decades old model using open MP. Learned R to use a specific maximum likelihood project. Learned SAS to access old data on tapes that was desired for a new study.

- Automated tedious manual processes in Python & Perl.

- Mentored fellow coworkers in programming fundamentals and statistical languages.

- Improved performance and maintainability for a large, long running Federal Open Market Committee project by introducing configuration files, decoupled models, and teaching others how to update and maintain the model. 

- Co-Authored 3 published papers
